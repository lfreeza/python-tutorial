                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Python is an <strong>easy to learn</strong>, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>

                <p>Python is an <strong>interpreted language</strong>, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.<p>
                
                <p>Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>
                <li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>
                <li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Python is <em>extensible</em>: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension or command language for that application.</p>
                
                <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.</p>
